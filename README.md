# convert_string_to_array_using_c_plusplus

In this program I've explained how to get a sentence as input and process it 
character by character then each word is put into the array.

input: hello Iam jeeva
output:hello Iam jeeva ///you might feel that output and input are same , yeah it is but if you want to print 
                        //the 2nd word (Iam) you can do it by cout<<arr[1] which gives you (Iam)as output.
